Info about the Project
Photo-Analysis-of-Receipts
The analysis will be supported by Gemini AI and is based on Calendar-Weeks.
The User will upload a JPEG-File into a Calendar-Week-Subdirectory supported by an Upload-Website
The Subdirectories have each 9 digits and look like "2025CW_31" for Calendar-Week No. 31 of the Year 2025
I recommend a resolution of VGA (640x480 Pixel) for the JPEG-Files.

The program was developed on IDE PyCharm, means the environment has to be adapted according the used libraries.
Install pandas, dotenv, os, flask, pathlib by the "pip install command".
To run the Web-Application just execute the "app.py" and flask is starting a server on localhost on port 5000
To run the Console-Application just execute the "tasks.py"
As the Project was suffering on a "late start and narrow time table"
there are a few open points as features to be realized in future:
User Administration
Database Support
Logging Support
Web-Site-Supported Functions
Optionally Categories besides Food and NonFood Products
